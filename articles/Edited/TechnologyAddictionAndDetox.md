Technology spans a spread over a number of devices and platforms. From mobile phones, tablets, and video game consoles to social media. It is worth addressing how each of these listed items can slowly become an obsession.

Every obsession or addiction, from an obsession with gambling and drugs to video games and technology, are based on the same fundamental dynamic: the brain’s expectation that engaging in a specific activity will provide a reward. This reward may or may not be obvious to the tech addict. In fact, it’s sometimes counterintuitive since it poses a potential harm for the user. But our mind still takes it as a positive experience.

Smartphones, Tablets, Computers, The Internet, Video Games, Social Media, YouTube and few more can be termed as DRUGS for the technology addict. So here are a few signs that hints that you have addiction of
Technology :
- You reach for your phone instinctively whenever it buzzes or rings
- If you don’t check your phone after receiving an alert, you become anxious
- You experience symptoms of withdrawal if you can’t go online
- You’re routinely failing to meet your commitments or are habitually late because of technology
- When you check social media, you feel euphoric
- You often take your smartphone to the bathroom with you
- You are ready to sacrifice sleep to spend more time online
- Now you do not participate in activities that you once enjoyed in the past
- Your social skills have jailed to the point that you are uncomfortable around others

As we know addiction has many consequences. These consequences may range from psychological to physical. Depending on their severity and nature, they can make life worse or less enjoyable. It’s worth underscoring that technology has the ability to improve our lives in many ways. It can boost our effectiveness and increase our productivity at everything we do. But it’s only a tool. And like any other tool, it can wreak havoc if used poorly or thoughtlessly. The following are some of the most common side effects seen in Tech Addicts. Individually, these side effects may seem harmless but collectively, they show that continued overindulgence
with technology can produce drastic unwanted results.
- Increased Stress
- Inability To Concentrate
- Inconsistent Sleep Quality
- Decline In Social Life
- Vision Problems
- Back And Neck Pain
- Weight Gain
- Depression
- Lack Of Impulse Control
- Frequent Procrastination

So we have seen the symptoms and side effects of technology addiction. Now let us see how to detox this addiction or how can we minimize this addiction.

There are some ways to treat this addiction. One way is rehab. This approach works in the same way as alcohol or drug rehab. You visit a treatment center for a particular period of time - for example, a few weeks - during which your access to technology is restricted. Some clinics also offer outpatient programs, but as with outpatient alcohol or drug and rehab, there is a high rate of relapse.

The second approach is self-treatment. Instead of visiting any therapist or enrolling yourself into a rehab facility, you take the control in breaking your addiction. You’re in control. Here, we are talking about practicing a personal digital detox. The advantages of self-treatment are twofold. First, it’s less expensive than therapy or paying a rehab facility. Second, it causes less disruption to our present lifestyle. If you think the same, those two advantages are enough to seal the deal.
## Digital Detox:
A digital detox may involve ignoring or stepping away from all of your gadgets. This may include your smartphone, tablet, and laptop. There are many challenges to traveling this path. For example, you may find it impossible if your job requires you to use a computer. Also, how can you keep in touch with people without
phone calls, texts, and emails?

And what about withdrawal symptoms? A digital detox is like a drug detox. Your brain craves for the dopamine rush that results from your compulsiveness. Once you have cut off or limited your access to technology, you
will feel the pangs of withdrawal.

One important thing that you should remember is that breaking your addiction requires the removal of your smartphone and other tech tools. You also need to sever the connection, at least temporarily.

Think of it this way: if you were addicted to cocaine, you wouldn’t try to break your addiction by gradually reducing the number of lines you do each night. That strategy is guaranteed to fail. Rather, you’d check yourself into a clinic and undergo a complete detox, one with no access to cocaine.

That’s how you need to approach your addiction to technology. If you want to break the habit, regain control of your focus and productivity and stop feeling overwhelmed, you need to do a complete digital detox. You will probably need motivation for this detox. It is recommended for you to write down, in a list, as many ways your life will improve after you break your technology addiction. Review this list whenever you experience signs
of withdrawal.

Hope this may help you get wealthier health.
